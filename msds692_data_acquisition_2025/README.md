# USF MSDS692, Data Acquisition

## About this Repo
This repo includes data and codes used during the MSDS692, Data Acquisition class in Fall 2025.

Each folder indicates the day of the lecture (Ex. Day1, Day2, etc.) and includes corresponding example codes. Please note that I encourage you to work on `Skeleton` codes first, rather than just taking a look at example answer codes. Data are stored under the `Data` directory.
